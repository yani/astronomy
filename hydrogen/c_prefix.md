# Astronomy Engine (C/C++)

This is the complete programming reference for the C version of 
[Astronomy Engine](../../). It can be used directly from C++ programs also.
Other programming languages are supported. See the [home page](../../) for more info.

## Quick Start
To get started quickly, here are some [examples](../../demo/c/).

## Topic Index

### Position of Sun, Moon, and planets

| [HelioVector](#Astronomy_HelioVector) | Calculates vector with respect to the center of the Sun. |
| [GeoVector](#Astronomy_GeoVector)     | Calculates vector with respect to the center of the Earth. |
| [Equator](#Astronomy_Equator)         | Calculates right ascension and declination. |
| [Ecliptic](#Astronomy_Ecliptic)       | Calculates ecliptic latitude, longitude, and Cartesian coordinates. |
| [Horizon](#Astronomy_Horizon)         | Calculates horizontal coordinates (azimuth, altitude) for a given observer on the Earth. |

### Rise, set, and culmination times

| [SearchRiseSet](#Astronomy_SearchRiseSet) | Finds time of rise or set for a body as seen by an observer on the Earth. |
| [SearchHourAngle](#Astronomy_SearchHourAngle) | Finds when body reaches a given hour angle for an observer on the Earth. Hour angle = 0 finds culmination, the highest point in the sky. |

### Moon phases

| [MoonPhase](#Astronomy_MoonPhase) | Determines the Moon's phase expressed as an ecliptic longitude. |
| [SearchMoonQuarter](#Astronomy_SearchMoonQuarter) | Find the first quarter moon phase after a given date and time. |
| [NextMoonQuarter](#Astronomy_NextMoonQuarter) | Find the next quarter moon phase after a previous one that has been found. |

### Lunar perigee and apogee

| [SearchLunarApsis](#Astronomy_SearchLunarApsis) | Finds the next perigee or apogee of the Moon after a specified date. |
| [NextLunarApsis](#Astronomy_NextLunarApsis) | Given an already-found apsis, find the next perigee or apogee of the Moon. |

### Visual magnitude and elongation

| [Illumination](#Astronomy_Illumination) | Calculates visual magnitude and phase angle of bodies as seen from the Earth. |
| [SearchPeakMagnitude](#Astronomy_SearchPeakMagnitude) | Searches for the date and time Venus will next appear brightest as seen from the Earth. |
| [AngleFromSun](#Astronomy_AngleFromSun) | Returns full angle seen from Earth between body and Sun. |
| [Elongation](#Astronomy_Elongation) | Calculates ecliptic longitude angle between a body and the Sun, as seen from the Earth. |
| [SearchMaxElongation](#Astronomy_SearchMaxElongation) | Searches for the next maximum elongation event for Mercury or Venus that occurs after the given date. |

### Oppositions and conjunctions

| [SearchRelativeLongitude](#Astronomy_SearchRelativeLongitude) | Find oppositions and conjunctions of planets. |

### Equinoxes and solstices

| [Seasons](#Astronomy_Seasons) | Finds the equinoxes and solstices for a given calendar year. |
